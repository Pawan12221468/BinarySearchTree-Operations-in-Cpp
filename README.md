#Binary Search Tree Operations in C++

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ with basic operations such as insertion, search, and deletion of nodes. The BST is a fundamental data structure that supports dynamic set operations.

Features:-

1)Insert: Add a new node with a given value to the BST.
2)Search: Find a node with a given value in the BST.
3)Delete: Remove a node with a given value from the BST.
4)Menu-Driven Interface: A simple command-line interface to interact with the BST.

#Usage

1)Insert a value into the tree.
2)Search for a value in the tree.
3)Delete a value from the tree.
4)Exit the program.
